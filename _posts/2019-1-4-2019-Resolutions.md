At the start of every year, I try to come up with a short list of resolutions for the upcoming year. This year, I want to make an active effort to set realistic, achievable expectations for myself, along with smaller action plans that will help me fulfill the items on the list. This is the list I have created for 2019!


### 1) *Work towards a healthier lifestyle*
- Between school and work, I sometimes find myself accidentally skipping a meal every once in a while, so this is a goal I really want to focus on!
- I am focusing on doing more meal-prep the night before, so I can grab to-go meals when I am in a rush.
- Extra focus will be put on including all four food groups in my diet, and to increase vegetable and fruit intake.
- I also want to make more frequent visits to the gym and make time for exercise at least twice a week!


### 2) *Maintain good study habits*
- I have created a stricter study schedule for each of my classes, with additional times to review content that I have already learned before, especially during the less intensive periods of the quarter.


### 3) *Maintaining consistent blog posts*
- This is something new that I wanted to start up this year. I have explained this a bit in my first blog post [here](https://amberhsu.me/first-post/). 
- I want to record the thoughts that come up in my daily life, and I want to follow a semi-consistent posting schedule.
- Putting things down on (metaphorical) paper has always helped me with organizing my thoughts, and I am hoping that blogging could become a therapeutic activity of sorts for me.


### 4) *Learn the basics of playing guitar*
- I recently acquired a second-hand guitar, and I want to learn how to play it when I have extra down-time on my hands.
- While I have some prior experience with other instruments, I have never played any type of string instrument before, so I am really excited to try guitar!


I'm excited for 2019, and I hope you all are too. Here's to the best year to come!
